# Bob Odenkirk - or Better Call Saul

Odenkirk was born in Berwyn, Illinois, then raised in Naperville. He is one of seven siblings born to Walter Odenkirk, who was employed in the printing business, and Barbara Odenkirk, Catholics of Irish, German, and Dutch descent. His parents divorced in part due to Walters alcoholism, which influenced Bobs decision to avoid alcohol as much as possible. 
He describes his father as remote, fucked-up, and not around. Odenkirk would later say that he grew up hating Naperville because it felt like a dead end, like Nowheresville. I couldn't wait to move into a city and be around people who were doing exciting things. Walter Odenkirk died of bone cancer in 1986.
